From the trials we can conclude that greedy algorithm is very fast and efficient, sometimes 

greedy give optimal solution also. Greedy algorithm is suggested for low data or a little of 

vertex. Backtracking algorithm is fast and very efficient, backtracking always give optimum 

data. Backtracking is suggested for a lot of data or a lot of vertex. The minimum color needed 

is based on the connection of vertex, amount of vertex and what algorithm that we use. The 

result of graph coloring is we show the graph that already been colored.
