Study case:
In our project, we will use the problem such as: “Given graph with n amount of vertex and each 
vertex has their own neighbours. How much is the minimum color needed and what’s the result 
of graph coloring using Greedy and Backtracking Algorithm? Which algorithm is faster and 
more effective?” 


Experimental Results 

The experimental results are shown by the graph below:  

Fig. 1 Comparison of time complexity from two algorithms. 
 
Based on the graph above, the result of greedy algorithm is always faster than Backtracking 
Algorithm. Average time of Greedy Algorithm is 0.171875 while Backtracking Algorithm’s 
average time is 0.296875. Also, the more nodes in the graph, the more time needed to solve the 
problem.
